# ML Algorithms Demo

This repository contains Python implementations of classic machine learning algorithms, each demonstrated with suitable datasets. The goal is to provide clear and practical examples for learning and experimentation.

## Contents

1. **Linear Regression** (`linear.py`)
    - Demonstrates linear regression on a sample dataset.
    - Shows model fitting, visualization, and evaluation.

2. **Logistic Regression** (`logisitc.py`)
    - Demonstrates logistic regression for binary classification.
    - Includes model training, prediction, and performance metrics.

3. **Decision Tree (ID3 Algorithm)** (`decision tree.py`)
    - Implements the ID3 decision tree algorithm.
    - Uses a dataset to build the decision tree and classifies a new sample.

4. **Naive Bayes Algorithm** (`Naive Bayes algorithm.py`)
    - Implements the Naive Bayes classifier.
    - Uses the Iris dataset.
    - Prints both correct and incorrect predictions.

5. **k-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm** (`k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm.py`)
    - Implements the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier.
    - Uses the Iris dataset.
    - Prints both correct and incorrect predictions.
